Some literature abou exporting Exif to a database: http://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/faq.html#Q12

This program attracted me because it featured a command-line option, exporting feature, and it supported many file types (specifically Nikon's .NEF filetype that I use). The only draw-back is that it exports *all* the Exif data (all 448 fields), which was a bit of a pain to comb through. This wasn't all bad, as some other programs would exempt certain fields for certain files, which lead to these entries having mis-aligned columns in the exported file.
