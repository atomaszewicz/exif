# Info about ExifTool
Phil Harvey's ExifTool can be found here: http://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/

Some literature about exporting Exif to a database: http://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/faq.html#Q12

This program attracted me because it featured a command-line option, an exporting feature, and it supported many file types (specifically Nikon's .NEF filetype, which I use). The only draw-back is that it exports *all* the Exif data (all 448 fields), which was a bit of a pain to comb through. Overall it worked very well and I would like to thank Phil Harvey for making such a great program.
